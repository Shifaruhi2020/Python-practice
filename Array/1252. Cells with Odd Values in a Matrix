PROBLEM :
----------------------------
There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

For each location indices[i], do both of the following:

Increment all the cells on row ri.
Increment all the cells on column ci.
Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix is [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]], which contains 6 odd numbers.
Example 2:


Input: m = 2, n = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There are no odd numbers in the final matrix.




SOLUTION:
-------------------------------------
class Solution:
    def oddCells(self, m: int, n: int, indices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        matrix=[]
        count=0
#         below is done to create an empty matrix with the given dimentions
        for i in range(m):
            l=[]
            for j in range(n):
                l.append(0)
            matrix.append(l[:])
        print (matrix)
#         the above print gives us= [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
# we r now goin to iterate thru the given matrix having the list 
# [x=[1,1],y=[0,0]]
#   r c   r  c
# in the position of r and c we will increment the value in the new matrix to 1
# at x iter r=1,c=1 hence in the matrix at 1st row we will increment 1 and at column 1 we will incerement 1 at y iter r=0,c=0 hence row 0 inc 1 and at col 0 inc 1
        for r,c in indices:
            for k in range(n):
                matrix[r][k]+=1
            for z in range(m):
                matrix[z][c]+=1
#    count var is used to count the no.of odd values in the new matrix      
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                # print(matrix)
                if matrix[i][j]%2!=0:
                    print(matrix[i][j]%2)
                    count+=1
        return count
